# caffeine-prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed to predict caffeine consumption or its effects based on various factors using machine learning techniques.
Project Overview

The Caffeine Prediction Project aims to predict caffeine intake levels or outcomes (such as energy levels, productivity, etc.) based on input data such as time of day, personal habits, or consumption history. This notebook uses various machine learning algorithms to explore patterns and provide predictions.


## Requirements

To run this notebook, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

or

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/caffeine-prediction.git
cd caffeine-prediction
```

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook caffeine_prediction.ipynb
```

Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train models, and evaluate performance.

Results

The models will output predictions about caffeine consumption or its effects based on the input features. The notebook includes code to visualize model performance and display key insights.
